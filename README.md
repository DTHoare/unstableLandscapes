Terrain generation in Processing 3

The code uses the diamond-square algorithm to generate landscapes.
Waves are created with perlin-noise amplified sinusoidal waves.

The terrain is shown as an isometric block of land, with directional lighting.

Also includes a class for 2D terrain generation, initially used a proof of concept.
